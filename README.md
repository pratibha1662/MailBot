# MailBot – Python-Based Email Automation Tool

MailBot is a lightweight, Python-based email automation tool designed to streamline marketing campaigns. It leverages the Gmail API with OAuth 2.0 authentication to ensure secure and efficient bulk email delivery, and is deployed seamlessly on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In addition to automation, MailBot features AI integration that helps users generate compelling email content — simply provide a subject idea, and the AI automatically crafts a professional subject line and email body. Whether you're a startup, freelancer, student, or marketing enthusiast, MailBot helps you reach your audience quickly and effortlessly.

## Why I Built This

I built MailBot to solve a common problem in small-scale marketing: the hassle of manually sending repetitive emails. During one of my projects, I realized how time-consuming it was to handle outreach using traditional methods. This project was an opportunity to:

- Learn and implement the Gmail API and OAuth authentication
- Gain hands-on experience deploying on GCP
- Automate a real-world task and improve productivity
- Integrate AI capabilities for content generation and user convenience

It’s a tool I wish I had earlier — now it's built to help others save time too.

### Key Features of MailBot:

- Bulk Email Sending: Upload a .txt file with email addresses and send messages in bulk with one click.
- Secure Gmail Integration: Uses Gmail API with OAuth 2.0 for secure and authenticated email delivery.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple UI for generating, editing, previewing, and managing email campaigns.
- Real-Time Feedback: Get instant confirmation once emails are successfully sent.
