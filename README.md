#MailBot – Python-Based Email Automation Tool

MailBot is a lightweight, Python-based email automation tool designed to streamline marketing campaigns. Built with the Gmail API and deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), it enables secure, efficient bulk email delivery with just a few simple steps. Whether you're a startup, freelancer, or marketing enthusiast, MailBot helps you reach your audience faster with less effort.

##Why I Built This

I built MailBot to solve a common problem in small-scale marketing: the hassle of manually sending repetitive emails. During one of my projects, I realized how time-consuming it was to handle outreach using traditional methods. This project was an opportunity to:
- Learn and implement the Gmail API and OAuth authentication
- Gain hands-on experience deploying on GCP
- Automate a real-world task and improve productivity
It’s a tool I wish I had earlier — now it's built to help others save time too.
