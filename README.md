# MailBot – Python-Based Email Automation Tool

MailBot is a lightweight, Python-based email automation tool designed to streamline marketing campaigns. It leverages the Gmail API with OAuth 2.0 authentication to ensure secure and efficient bulk email delivery, all deployed seamlessly on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Whether you're a startup, freelancer, student, or marketing enthusiast, MailBot helps you reach your audience quickly and effortlessly.

## Why I Built This

I built MailBot to solve a common problem in small-scale marketing: the hassle of manually sending repetitive emails. During one of my projects, I realized how time-consuming it was to handle outreach using traditional methods. This project was an opportunity to:
- Learn and implement the Gmail API and OAuth authentication
- Gain hands-on experience deploying on GCP
- Automate a real-world task and improve productivity

It’s a tool I wish I had earlier — now it's built to help others save time too.
