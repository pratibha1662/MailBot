# MailBot – Python-Based Email Automation Tool

MailBot is a lightweight, Python-based email automation tool designed to streamline marketing campaigns. It leverages the Gmail API with OAuth 2.0 authentication to ensure secure and efficient bulk email delivery, all deployed seamlessly on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Whether you're a startup, freelancer, student, or marketing enthusiast, MailBot helps you reach your audience quickly and effortlessly.

## Why I Built This

I built MailBot to solve a common problem in small-scale marketing: the hassle of manually sending repetitive emails. During one of my projects, I realized how time-consuming it was to handle outreach using traditional methods. This project was an opportunity to:

- Learn and implement the Gmail API and OAuth authentication
- Gain hands-on experience deploying on GCP
- Automate a real-world task and improve productivity

It’s a tool I wish I had earlier — now it's built to help others save time too.

### This website application provides the following functionality:

- Allows users to upload a plain text file containing a list of email recipients.
- Provides a simple interface to compose the subject and body of the email.
- Sends bulk emails automatically using the Gmail API with secure OAuth authentication.
- Displays real-time status or confirmation once emails are sent.
- Eliminates the need for manually sending emails one by one.
- Helps streamline marketing efforts, event promotions, or organizational communication.
- Can be used by startups, freelancers, students, and clubs to reach a wider audience efficiently.
